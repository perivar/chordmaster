[A]    When the rain is blowing [E/G#]in your face
[G]    And the whole world is [D/F#]on your case

[A]    When the evening shadows and [E/G#]the stars appear
[G]    And there is no one there to dr[D/F#]y your tears

[Dmaj7]   The storms are raging on the r[A]olling sea
[C#7/F]   And on the [Dmaj7]highway of regret[A]
[Dmaj7]   Though winds of change are blowing [A]wild and free
[B7]You ain't seen nothing like me y[E7]et

{start_of_verse}
[A]I could make you happy make [E/G#]your dreams come true
[G]   Nothing that I w[D/F#]ouldn't do

[B7]   To make you f[E7sus4]eel my l[A]ove
[B7]   To make you f[E7sus4]eel my l[A]ove

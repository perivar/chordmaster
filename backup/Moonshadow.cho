Oh, [D]I'm bein' followed by a [A7]moon[D]shadow, [G]moon shadow, [A7]moonshadow---
[D]Leapin and hoppin' on a [A7]moon[D]shadow, [G]moonshadow, [A7]moon[D]shadow---

And [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]hands, [G]lose my [D]plough, [Em]lose my [A7]land,
Oh [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]hands, Oh [Em]i--[A7]---[D]--[A/C#]-----[Bm] I [Em]won't have to [A]work no [D]more.

And [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]eyes, [G]if my [D]colours [Em]all run [A7]dry,
Yes [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]eyes, Oh [Em]i--[A7]â€”--[D]--[A/C#]-----[Bm] I [Em]won't have to [A]cry no m[D]ore.

[E7]Did it take long to fi[A]nd me?  [E]I asked the faithful [A]light.

{comment: Verse}
Buona s[Bb]era, signorina, buona s[Bb]era
It is t[Bb]ime to say goodnight to Napo[F7]li
Though it's h[F7]ard for us to whisper Buona [F7]Sera
With that old m[F7]oon above the Mediterranean [Bb]Sea
+
In the m[Bb]orning, signorina, we'll go w[Bb]alking
Where the m[Bb]ountains and the s[Bb7]un  come into s[Eb]ight
And by the l[Ebm]ittle jewler shop we stop and [Bb]linger
While I [F7]buy a wedding ring for your f[Bb]inger
In the mean[Bb7]time let me tell you that I l[Eb]ove you
Buona s[Bb]era signor[F]ina kiss me good n[Bb]ight
Buona s[F]era signorina kiss me good ni[Bb]ght![N.C.]

{comment: Intro}
[C]

{start_of_verse: 1}
And [C]now, ...the end is [Em/B]near,
And so I [Gm6/Bb]face  ...the final [A7]curtain,[A7sus4]
My [Dm]friend, I'll say it [Dm/C]clear,
I'll state my [G7/B]case, ...of [G7]which I'm [Csus4]certain,[C]
[C/G]I've [C]lived  [Cmaj7]   ...a live that's [Gm7/C]full,[C7]
I traveled [F]each and every [Fm6]highway,
And [C/G]more, much more than [G]this, [G7]I did it [Dm/C]my---- [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: 2}
Re - [C]grets, I've had a [Em/B]few,
But, then a - [Gm6/Bb]gain,  ...too few to [A7]mention,[A7sus4]
I [Dm]did ...what I had to [Dm/C]do,
And saw it [G7/B]through ...with - [G7]out ex - [Csus4]emption,[C]
[C/G]I    [C]planned  [Cmaj7]    ...each charted [Gm7/C]course,[C7]
Each [C7b9]careful [F]step along the [Fm6]by-way,
And [C/G]more, much more than [G]this, [G7]I did it [Dm/C]my---- [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: 3}
[Em]Yes, [G7]there were [C]times, [Cmaj7]    ...I'm sure you [Gm7/C]knew,[C7]
When I bit [Fadd9]off ...[F]more than I could [Fmaj7]chew,[F6]
But [Em7]through it [Dm7]all, ...when there was [G]doubt,
[G/F]    I ate it [Em]up, [Em7] ...and spit it [Am]out [Am7] ...I faced it [Dm7]all,
And [Dm]I  [Dm7]stood [G]tall, [G7]and I did it [Dm/C]my---- [C]way!
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: 4}
[C/G]I've [C]loved, I've laughed and [Em/B]cried,
I've had my [Gm6/Bb]fill,  ...my share of [A7]losing,[A7sus4]
And [Dm]now, as tears sub - [Dm/C]side,
I find it [G7/B]all  ...[G7]so a - [Csus4]mus - [C]ing,
[C/G]To   [C]think [Cmaj7]    ...I did all [Gm7/C]that,[C7b5]
And, may I [F]say-[Faug]----, [F6] ...[F]not in a [Fadd9]shy   [F]way[Fmaj7],[Fm6]
Oh, [C/G]no  ...oh, no, not [G]me, [G7]   I did it [Dm/C]my---- [C]way!
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: 5}
For [Em]what [G7]is a [C]man?  [Cmaj7]      What has he [Gm7/C]got?[C7b9]
If not him - [Fadd9]self,  [F]  ...then he has [Fadd9]not...[F]
...To [Em]say the [Dm7]things he truly [G]feels,[G/F]
And not the [Em]words [Em7] ...of one who [Am]kneels,[Am7]
The record [Dm7]shows I took the [G]blows,[G7]
And I did it [Dm/C]my----- [C]way
{end_of_verse}
